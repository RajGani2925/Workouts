# Workouts 💪📝

Welcome to my chaotic world of Jupyter notebooks! 🐍💻  
These are my **personal practice notebooks** where I break stuff, fix stuff, and learn stuff. ⚡💥  

**Disclaimer:** Not polished, not perfect, not a magic copy-paste solution. Just my playground for ML, data analysis, and Python shenanigans. 🎢🤓  

## Contents 📚
- Notebooks on classification, regression, visualization, preprocessing, and more.  
- Experiments, trial-and-error code, and brain farts 🤯💡.  

## Purpose 🎯
To level up my Python & ML skills, test ideas, and sometimes just stare at error messages 😅💥.  

## Usage 🚫
For my eyes only (and learning). May contain bugs, half-baked ideas, and random emojis. Not meant for cloning or copying. 🙈
